# Trying out SDL and WASM
Small dvd like screensaver to get familiar with SDL and WASM.  

# Buiding 
`make` then run `./game`, if you want the regular game.    
`make wasm` to compile to wasm then `emrun index.html`, if you want the web version.  

# Rectangles galore 
Pressing n spawns more rectangles.  
Im not responsible for any headaches caused by staring at them :).
